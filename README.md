# 🧠 AI Search Agent  

**My first end-to-end AI agent build — focused on secure key management, LangChain workflows, and agent optimization.**  

Inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUC-hyjpNxk), this project was my first deep dive into **AI agent design** using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and Python.  

I didn’t just follow along — I took notes, documented concepts, and focused on **why agents are structured the way they are**, especially around workflows and security.

## ✨ What I Learned  
- **Secrets management** → how to safely store API keys with `.env` instead of hardcoding them  
- **Agent architecture** → memory, reasoning loops, and tools as the building blocks of an AI agent  
- **Workflow design** → breaking down tasks into modular steps that can be optimized or swapped  
- **Agent optimization** → refining prompts, tool selection, and reasoning for better outcomes  
- **LangChain fundamentals** → chaining models, tools, and logic in a flexible framework

## 📝 Notes & Documentation  
This repo includes **extensive in-code notes** to reinforce my understanding. They cover:  
- Explanations of LangChain functions in plain language  
- Step-by-step breakdowns of how the agent works  
- Reflections on design choices and tradeoffs  

The notes turn this repo into both a **project** and a **learning log** — showing not just what I built, but how I thought about it.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated  
- **Python** scripting & modular design  
- **LangChain** for agent workflows  
- **Secure coding** practices with `.env` + `.gitignore`  
- **API integration** basics  
- **Documentation & explanation** — making complex ideas accessible

## 💡 Time Permitting, I would
- Experiment with memory types (short-term vs. long-term)  
- Add external tools (search, file loaders, APIs)  
- Package as a microservice or chatbot  
- Explore evaluation strategies for agent performance
